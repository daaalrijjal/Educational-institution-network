# Educational-institution-network


This project outlines the network design for a medium-sized educational institution with three campuses—North, South, and Central. Each campus is dedicated to specific functions and operates within its own VLAN to enhance security and efficiency.

- **North Campus:** Focuses on Computer Science and Engineering, with labs, classrooms, and faculty offices.
- **South Campus:** Dedicated to Business Studies, with seminar halls and administrative spaces.
- **Central Campus:** The administrative hub, including offices, finance, HR, and a central library.

The VLAN-based architecture supports secure communication, resource allocation, and scalability.

## End Devices

- **PCs, Laptops, Tablets:** Used across labs, offices, and by students for academic and administrative purposes.
- **Printers:** Located in various departments for document printing.
- **DHCP & DNS Servers:** Manage IP assignments and ensure internal resources are accessible via domain names.

## Intermediate Devices

- **Switches and Routers:** Manage VLAN traffic and ensure connectivity across campuses.
- **Access Points (APs):** Provide wireless network access within campuses.
- **Routing Protocol:** RIP is configured to handle routing between VLANs efficiently.
