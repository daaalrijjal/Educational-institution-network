# Educational-institution-network


This project involves the design and simulation of a network using Cisco Packet Tracer for an educational institution spanning three distinct campuses: North, South, and Central. Each campus has specialized roles—North focuses on Computer Science and Engineering, South on Business Studies, and Central serves as the administrative hub.

The network architecture is structured using VLANs to segregate traffic and ensure secure, efficient communication between campuses. These VLANs are interconnected through a variety of networking mediums, facilitating seamless data flow and collaboration across different departments.

To manage the network effectively, various protocols are employed. These include DHCP for dynamic IP address allocation, ensuring that devices within each VLAN can communicate without manual configuration. Additionally, security protocols and routing configurations are in place to enforce access restrictions, maintain data integrity, and manage inter-campus communication.

Overall, the network is designed to meet the diverse needs of the institution, providing robust, scalable, and secure connectivity for both academic and administrative functions across all campuses.
